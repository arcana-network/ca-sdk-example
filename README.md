# CA-SDK: Sample Integration 

This repository contains sources of a typical Vue3 + TypeScript + Vite sample application that integrates with the Arcana CA SDK.

This sample app is generated using the Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs. Check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more. For details about the recommended project setup and IDE support, see [Vue Docs TypeScript Guide](https://vuejs.org/guide/typescript/overview.html#project-setup).

The following files were updated in the original sample code to integrate with the CA SDK:

* src/App.vue
* src/utils/getCA.ts
* src/components/Transfer.vue
* src/components/PreLogin.vue
* src/components/BalanceSidebar.vue

Use the CA SDK [Quick Start Guide](https://docs.arcana.network/quick-start/ca-quick-start/), [SDK Reference Guide](https://ca-sdk-ref-guide.netlify.app/) and the [Usage Guide](https://docs.arcana.network/ca/ca-usage-guide/) for details.
